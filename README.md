Ideas
Ideally, all inside Django

1. ???

2. A script that takes text input (maybe a text box that you copy/paste into) and it finds all email addresses in that text and returns them in a tidy list. This could be a cool tool to host on your website, too. It will require some regex knowledge, which is a good thing to have. Perhaps a simply Django or Flask web app?

3. Python has a number of statistics and data science libraries. Can you pick a task like analyzing some website traffic data and show how to do it in 3 different libraries?

4. Python also has some libraries for Natural Language Processing. Can you scrape the top articles from 3 different top news sites on a particular topic (business sector, product, person, etc) and do a language analysis of it? This could be useful for marketing and product development teams.

5. Write a script that takes a CSV input and then automatically fills out online forms with the contents of the spreadsheet so someone doesn’t have to manually do it 50 times.

6. Write a script that takes the contents of a folder (let’s call them a bunch of images pulled down from the internet with random file names) and renames them to a consistent naming pattern that you can use. Add another level of complexity by including more folders of images inside that main folder. Also throw in a .docx file or two to throw the renamer off (you want different naming conventions)
