Ideas

1. Scrap 3 notes from X site

2. A script that takes text input (maybe a text box that you copy/paste into) and it finds all email addresses in that text and returns them in a tidy list. This could be a cool tool to host on your website, too. It will require some regex knowledge, which is a good thing to have. Perhaps a simply Django or Flask web app?

3. simple pygame

4. Empaquetado, pip, easy_install

5. Python also has some libraries for Natural Language Processing. Get articles from 3 different top news sites on a particular topic (business sector, product, person, etc) and do a language analysis of it? This could be useful for marketing and product development teams.
