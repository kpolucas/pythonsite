Ideas

1. Scrap 3 notes from X site

2. A script that takes text input (maybe a text box that you copy/paste into) and it finds all email addresses in that text and returns them in a tidy list. This could be a cool tool to host on your website, too. It will require some regex knowledge, which is a good thing to have. Perhaps a simply Django or Flask web app?

3. simple pygame

4. Empaquetado, pip, easy_install

5. A simple api client a simple api server

6. Full site django
